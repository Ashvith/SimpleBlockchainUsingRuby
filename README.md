# Simple blockchain program in Ruby

[`blockchain_simple.rb`](blockchain_simple.rb) is a very basic implementation of the blockchain using Ruby.

The same implementation can be converted into a very basic Proof-Of-Work blockchain - the code can be found inside [blockchain_pow.rb](blockchain_pow.rb).
